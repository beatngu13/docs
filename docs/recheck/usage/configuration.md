# Configuration

We use [*convention over configuration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) to configure the behavior of ***recheck***. Thus unless your setup does not fit to the default mechanism, you should not have to configure anything.

Tools we use for code development, and thus are configured as the default:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

Tools we do not (actively) use, but support:

- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [JUnit4](https://junit.org/junit4/)
- [TestNG](https://testng.org)[^1]

!!! tip
    If you feel that the tools you are using are not supported or lack support, you are welcome to implement or improve the support for the respective tool and [create a pull request](https://github.com/retest/recheck/pulls) or [create an issue](https://github.com/retest/recheck/issues).

## RecheckOptions

The [`RecheckOptions`](https://github.com/retest/recheck/blob/master/src/main/java/de/retest/recheck/RecheckOptions.java) are used to configure the behavior of `Recheck` or similar classes that may use a `Recheck` instance internally. They use the [builder pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) and cannot be changed, once they are created (i.e. they are immutable).

```java
RecheckOptions options = RecheckOptions.builder()
    // Do your configuration here
    .build()
```

!!! warning
    If the default or automatic systems does not fit your needs or produce the wrong results, you must specify the respective options manually.

### Usage

The options can be easily passed to the [`RecheckImpl`](https://github.com/retest/recheck/blob/master/src/main/java/de/retest/recheck/RecheckImpl.java).

```java
Recheckoptions opts = RecheckOptions.builder()
    // Do your configuration here
    .build();
Recheck re = new RecheckImpl( opts );
```

!!! note
    All available `Recheck` instances should honor all available options from `RecheckOptions`.

### Options

Below is a list of the available options you may configure with corresponding methods on `RecheckOptionsBuilder`. Please refer to the detailed sections below.

All options annotated with *"Evaluate"* below will be queried with the creation of the `RecheckOptions` instance, either retrieving (by the methods described), instantiating or loading the proper value.

| Option                | Default                                                                                                                                                                 | Description                                                                                    | Evaluate |

| `projectLayout`       | [`MavenProjectLayout`](https://github.com/retest/recheck/blob/master/src/main/java/de/retest/recheck/persistence/MavenProjectLayout.java)                               | Defines where the Golden Masters and reports are located.                                      |          |
| `suiteName`           | `null`                                                                                                                                                                  | Overwrite the name for the suite.<br>If `null`, `NamingStrategy#getSuiteName()` is used.       | true     |

| `ignore`              | `recheck.ignore`                                                                                                                                                        | Set the filter used for reporting the differences after a test phase.<br>*See examples below*. | true     |

### Example

```java
RecheckOptions.builder()
        .namingStrategy( new ClassAndMethodBasedShortNamingStrategy() )
        .projectLayout( new GradleProjectLayout() )
        .suiteName( "my-custom-suite-name" )
        .enableReportUpload()
        .addIgnore( "MyCustomIgnore.filter" )
        .build();
```

### Locating Files

Per default, we assume a Maven project with JUnit. The files are located under the following folders:

1. Golden Masters: `src/test/resources/retest/recheck/`
2. Reports: `target/test-classes/retest/recheck/`

You may change the location of files using a custom [`ProjectLayout`](https://github.com/retest/recheck/blob/master/src/main/java/de/retest/recheck/persistence/ProjectLayout.java) or define the name using a custom [`NamingStrategy`](https://github.com/retest/recheck/blob/master/src/main/java/de/retest/recheck/persistence/NamingStrategy.java) as described in the [lifecycle](../introduction/usage.md).

!!! warning
    The `suiteName` is evaluated to provide a consistent name for the `RecheckOptions`. The automatic system does not work with some usages (e.g. inheritance) and thus require a custom `suiteName` to be defined.

#### Upload Reports to rehub

When executing your tests on a CI, it may not be straightforward to access the created reports. For this we offer a way to [upload](../../recheck-web/tutorial/upload-test-reports-to-rehub.md) your reports to ***rehub*** so that you can easily update your Golden Masters.

If the upload of the report fails (e.g connectivity issues, timeout, ...), ***recheck*** will try to re-upload the report, provided that the report contains differences. If the upload still fails after a specified number of attempts, the causing error is thrown. The upload will not be retried if the report has no differences and all exceptions will be silenced, so the test can continue to run.

!!! warning
    The upload or re-upload of the report is aborted after 5 minutes after the initial upload request.

### Using Filters

Per default, we load the `recheck.ignore` files as specified in [filters](filter.md). Thus, the `suiteName` is a required dependency to be evaluated before, so that the filters are loaded from the correct Golden Master.

If you want specify additional filters (e.g. your custom project filters), you may use their full name (e.g. `"MyCustomIgnore.filter"`). There are several methods to add, update or disable filters:

1. `RecheckOptionsBuilder#addIgnore( String )`: Will append a filter.
2. `RecheckOptionsBuilder#setIgnore( String )`: Will overwrite the filter.
3. `RecheckOptions#ignoreNothing()`: Will remove all filters.

## Properties

***recheck*** offers some properties that can be used for configuration. You can either set these via the `.retest/retest.properties` file or using actual [system properties](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/sysprop.html). (Note that the latter overwrites the former.)

```properties
# If true, reports will be uploaded to rehub.
# "true" or "false".
de.retest.recheck.rehub.reportUploadEnabled=false

# Retry attempts to upload reports to rehub if initial upload fails
# Any positive integer
de.retest.recheck.rehub.upload.attempts=3

# Always ignore these attributes, even if no ignore or filter is active.
# Any string, separate values with ";".
de.retest.recheck.ignore.attributes=absolute-outline

# If set, recheck will use this path as the project root (containing e.g. the .retest folder).
# Any valid absolute path.
de.retest.recheck.project.root=null

# Minimal match threshold between old and new element to safely assume it's actually the same. 
# Any double in the interval [0.0, 1.0].
de.retest.recheck.elementMatchThreshold=0.3
```

[^1]: Note that JUnit and TestNG is supported by default through `ClassAndMethodBasedNamingStrategy`.
